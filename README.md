## 🛠 Libraries & Tools Used

- `turtle` — for graphics and animation
- `random` — for randomized game behavior
- `time` — for delays and timing events
- `csv` — for handling game data like states and scores
- `os`, `sys` — for system-level operations and file handling

---

## 💡 Skills & Concepts Practiced

- Game loops, event handling, and screen updates
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- User input/output and data validation
- File reading/writing and data storage
- Working with coordinates, sprites, and game boundaries
- Modular Python coding and debugging

# 🎮 Python Projects & Games Repository

Welcome to my collection of Python projects! This repo showcases fun and educational games I’ve built using Python, along with the libraries and concepts I’ve mastered along the way.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🎲 Games
- **Coin Flip**: Simulates a virtual coin toss using Python’s `random` module.
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: A user vs computer CLI game—both powered by `random` and `if` logic.
- **Treasure Island**: A text-based adventure game showcasing decision-making and branching logic.
- **Bill Pay**: A simple finance utility to manage and track bill payments.
- **Turtle Race**: A graphical race simulation using the `turtle` module to render moving sprites.

### ✅ Features & Skills Applied
- **Control flow**: conditionals (`if/elif/else`), loops (`for`, `while`)
- **User input and output handling**
- **Randomness**: via Python’s built-in `random` module
- **File handling**: reading/writing CSV or JSON for logging (Bill Pay)
- **Modular coding**: functions, separation of concerns
- **Graphics with `turtle`**: basic animation & drawing

## 🛠 Libraries & Technologies

| Library        | Version | Purpose                                       |
|----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| `random`       | Built-In| Random outcomes (games, events)               |
| `turtle`       | Built-In| Drawing and animating graphics (Turtle Race) |
| `time`         | Built-In| Pausing game loops and animations             |
| `os`, `csv`, `json` | Built-In| File path handling & data storage       |
| `sys`          | Built-In| Command-line execution / exiting             |

## 🌱 What I Learned
1. **Game logic structure**: handling rounds, scoring, and ending conditions.
2. **Working with users**: input validation and clear outputs.
3. **Basic GUI animation** using `turtle`.
4. **Organizing projects**: modular design and proper version control with Git.

## 🚀 How to Set Up & Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SANDEEPNEGI07/Python_projects.git
